        Create a progress navigation with previous/next buttons on each step and an overview of all steps.
        Clicking next button on last step should bring the final screen
        Steps in overview should be also clickable and change current step to the one click,
        however you shouldn't be able to skip the next step, so if you're at 1 step - you can't go directly to 3.
